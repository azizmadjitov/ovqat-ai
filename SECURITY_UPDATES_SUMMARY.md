# Supabase Security Updates Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the Supabase security warnings.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Anonymous Access Policies Warning** - Tables had RLS policies that allowed access to anonymous users
2. **Leaked Password Protection Warning** - This security feature was disabled
3. **Function Search Path Mutable Warning** - Functions had mutable search paths that could be exploited

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. SQL Security Fix Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/002_security_fixes.sql`

**Changes:**
- Removed all permissive policies that allowed anonymous access to any tables
- Created strict Row Level Security policies for all tables:
  - `select_own` - Users can only SELECT their own data
  - `insert_own` - Users can only INSERT their own data
  - `update_own` - Users can only UPDATE their own data
  - `delete_own` - Users can only DELETE their own data
- Created a secure function `check_phone_exists()` for phone number verification without exposing user data
- Revoked all permissions from `anon` and `PUBLIC` roles
- Granted appropriate permissions to `authenticated` role

### 2. Function Search Path Fix Migration
**File:** `supabase/migrations/003_fix_function_search_path.sql`

**Changes:**
- Fixed the `update_updated_at_column()` function to have a secure search_path
- Fixed the `check_phone_exists()` function to have a secure search_path
- Both functions now use `SET search_path = public, pg_temp` to prevent search path manipulation attacks

### 3. AuthService Update
**File:** `src/services/authService.ts`

**Changes:**
- Modified `createUserByPhone()` to properly handle existing users
- When an existing user logs in, the system now:
  - Creates a new anonymous session
  - Updates the user's auth ID in the database
  - Fetches complete user data from all relevant tables
  - Returns the correct onboarding status
- Fixed database queries to handle cases with no results or multiple results
- Removed problematic `.single()` calls that caused "cannot coerce the result to a single json object" errors
- Ensured proper user identification by phone number across devices

### 4. QuestionnaireService Update
**File:** `src/services/questionnaireService.ts`

**Changes:**
- Fixed database queries to handle cases with no results or multiple results
- Removed problematic `.single()` calls that caused "cannot coerce the result to a single json object" errors
- Added proper error handling for all database operations

### 5. LoginScreen Update
**File:** `components/LoginScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Maintained the existing onboarding status check logic
- Works in conjunction with the updated AuthService

### 6. Documentation Updates
**Files:** 
- `README.md` - Updated with security fixes section and user authentication flow fix
- `SECURITY_FIXES.md` - Detailed explanation of fixes (created earlier)
- This file (`SECURITY_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md`)

## Security Improvements

### Before
- Anonymous users could access data through permissive RLS policies
- No protection against leaked passwords
- Direct table queries exposed user data
- Functions had mutable search paths that could be exploited
- Database queries were prone to errors with `.single()` method
- User identification across devices was inconsistent

### After
- All tables restricted to authenticated users only
- RLS policies scoped to `auth.uid()` for row-level isolation
- Secure function for phone number checking without data exposure
- Leaked password protection can be enabled in dashboard
- No anonymous access to sensitive data
- Functions have secure search paths to prevent manipulation attacks
- Robust database query handling that prevents "cannot coerce the result to a single json object" errors
- Consistent user identification by phone number across all devices

## How to Apply the Fixes

The security fixes have been successfully applied to your database using the following command:

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This command applied all migrations:
1. `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/002_security_fixes.sql`
3. `supabase/migrations/003_fix_function_search_path.sql`

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
   - Save changes

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the Supabase Security Advisor should show no warnings for:
- Anonymous Access Policies
- Leaked Password Protection (after enabling in dashboard)
- Function Search Path Mutable

## Testing

1. Test user registration with a new phone number
2. Test user login with an existing phone number
3. Verify that users can only access their own data
4. Confirm that anonymous users cannot access any protected data
5. Verify that timestamp updates still work correctly
6. Test that existing users logging in from different devices go directly to MainScreen
7. Verify that no "cannot coerce the result to a single json object" errors occur
8. Confirm that user data is properly maintained across devices

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback these changes:

1. Revert to the previous migration state
2. Re-run the original schema migration: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
3. Re-apply the phone number lookup fix: `fix-rls-policy.sql`
